# Frigate-Notify

This lightweight docker container will act as a bridge between the Frigate NVR application and Ntfy service. It can also be configured to use other notification service apps, such as Gotify, Discord, Pushover, etc.

## Setup

Note that for integration with Ntfy, attachments are required to be enabled in Ntfy. This is because Frigate-Notify includes a screenshot of the Frigate alert in the notification, which is included as an attachment.
